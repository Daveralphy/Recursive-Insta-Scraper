## How It Works

- The bot starts by taking a list of seed Instagram usernames.
- It scrapes their followers and following lists, respecting the configured limit.
- For each scraped username, it performs a light scrape of their bio and name.
- Using AI filtering or keyword matching (Spanish and Portuguese keywords), it filters out irrelevant profiles.
- For approved profiles, it performs a full scrape to extract detailed info, including WhatsApp numbers and group links using regex.
- Profiles are classified into business types based on bio content.
- Results are exported cleanly and deduplicated into the chosen output format.

---

## Configuration

All configurable options are found in `config/config.yaml`. These include:

- Scrape limit (e.g., 500 or unlimited)
- Delay between requests (1‚Äì3 seconds recommended)
- Recursion toggle to feed found usernames back into scraping
- Proxy settings for rotation
